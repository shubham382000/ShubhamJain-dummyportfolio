Also, i have worked on few CLI apps previously. From it, made some quizees and shared with my friends. They are yet to review that.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, i will talk about my favourite movie and the book

1. Favourite Movie : FRIENDS, At very first sight, i thought this will be a normal as usual movie, this is until i watched and my whole mindset changed as i watched it. 
2. Favourite Book : As theres not one book i like the most, as in each genre theres a series of books i like the most. So, just taking up the genre of Self help i like "The Power Of Your Subconscious Mind" the most. 

Thanks guysss!!!!
